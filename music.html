I was thinking working on some project <span class="inciso">makes me happy.</span> Something everybody uses everyday, every moment. Something I can't live without it. Obviously: My Muuusic. With x3U because I really live every note, every song, every second of every piece. <br><br>The main difference between Muuusic and the rest of music players is that <span class="inciso">you can play with the sound wave</span> to move through the different movements and intensities of each song.<br><br><br>If you want to see more, you can <span class="inciso">scroll!</span></p></p></div>
